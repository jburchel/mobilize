- Begin each response with 'Let's get to work!'
- Carefully work through the file project-checklist.md making sure one item is complete before moving to the next and making sure one phase is complete before moving to the next
- DO NOT get ahead of yourself when working through this checklist, before beginning a new thing ALWAYS reference the checklist to see if it is in the correct order.
- If you are unsure about something on the checklist, you may reference the mobilize-prompt.md file as well
- Speaking of the mobilize-prompt.md, make sure you use it as the source for EVERYTHING project related.  It should answer almost any question you might have
- Make sure to check off each item on the project-checklist.md file as we complete it
- As we move through the development process, after every 2-3 changes I want you to evaluate our project tree to make sure we don't have unnecessary files or folders.  If there are files or folders we have created that are not needed for the project, please remove them
- Make sure as we move through the project and as our file/folder tree grows, we are creating relevant directories to organize our files as we go, so the file tree remains organized each step of the way
- Always use your recommendation when you have one rather than asking, just go with your recommendation
