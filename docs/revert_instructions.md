# Revert to Pre-Chat State Instructions

I've created a new branch named `revert_to_pre_chat_state` that contains the codebase as it was before my first commit in this chat session. This branch has been pushed to the remote repository.

## How to Use the Revert Branch

1. **Switch to the Revert Branch Locally:**
   - Run `git checkout revert_to_pre_chat_state` to switch to this branch.
   - If you don't see the branch, update your local repository with `git fetch origin` first.

2. **Review the State:**
   - This branch is set to commit `9262681 Address SQLAlchemy relationship warnings and cleanup project files`, which is before any changes from this chat.

3. **Options for Applying the Revert:**
   - **Option 1 - Merge to Main:** If you have permissions, you can merge this branch into `main` via a pull request on GitHub, or locally with `git checkout main && git merge revert_to_pre_chat_state`, then push the changes.
   - **Option 2 - Reset Main Branch:** If you can override branch protection (or temporarily disable it), checkout `main` and reset it to this branch with `git reset --hard revert_to_pre_chat_state`, then `git push --force`.
   - **Option 3 - Continue Working on Revert Branch:** You can continue working on `revert_to_pre_chat_state` as your new base branch for further development.

## Note

Due to branch protection rules on `main`, I couldn't directly revert the main branch history. This branch serves as a safe way to access the pre-chat state without altering `main` directly. If you need assistance with merging or resetting, please let me know.
